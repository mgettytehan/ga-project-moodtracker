## Summary

Big Mood is a web application for logging your mood.

There are a number of mood logging applications in existence, mainly designed with very specific mood measurements. Sometimes the measurements/questions and the scales that they use don't make sense to everyone. For example, it may be overwhelming to answer a questions about your wellbeing on a scale of 1-10: perhaps 0-4 makes more sense. Maybe you'd prefer to log your 'BS tolerance' rather than a more conventional measure. Perhaps colors make more sense than numbers on a scale.

The target user wants to keep a log of their mood so that they can monitor their wellbeing. They find it easier to use custom scales that they have created rather than the set measurements of similar applications.

In the current incarnation of the application, a user can log in, create and edit scales (text/number or color), log their moods, and view their mood history.
